Preprints are papers, which are not yet published by a professional publisher, but such a publication is planned and the publisher already accepted printing the work. Depending on the publisher there are several terms to be regarded by preprinting it. Many publishers require a link on our document repository, which references the final version on the publishers page. <b>Please tell us when your preprint is published</b>, so that we can accomplish the requirements of the publisher!
