After finishing filling out the form for metadata of your document you get an URN, which is used to identify your document in the net and makes it citable. You can put this URN into your documents fulltext. If you want to do that, please do not submit any file at the end of publication process! You can send us the file later (after you inserted the URN) by eMail. It's optional to do that, but it helps to identify printouts of your document.
