<h3>Security concept documentation</h3>
On TUBdok several security systems are supported.
<br/>
<ul>
<li>SSL</li>
Any communication between client and server can be done via HTTPS on SSL. Our certifcate is self-signed and not yet approved by a Certification Authority. Nevertheless you can communicate on SSL, so that the communication will be encrypted, that means you have a secure connection. You are not forced to use HTTPS (actually you can use normal HTTP as well), but it's recommended to use a secure connection.
<li>Checksums</li>

For each document published on TUBdok a checksum according to the MD5 algorithm is calculated. Doing that we can guarantee, that your documents has not been changed after you uploaded it, neither from us, nor from third persons. Calculation is done completely automated and the checksum is saved in the metadata for the document.
<li>Digital Signature</li>
You can sign your document digitally, using PGP or GPG signatures. Doing that you can approve, that this document in exactly this form is what you have published and we can guarantee that it authentic. You can send us your public key via the publication after you logged in with your password. The key can only be submitted after you were authenticated successfully.
<br/>
We also sign your document when we enable it. In addition to the checksums thios signature approves, that the document has not been changed since it is enabled. For accessibility and usability issues it is not obligatory to use digital signatures, but it's recommended.<br/>

<h3>Server description</h3>
<h4>Basics</h4>
TUBdok is one of our digital services and runs on a redundant web server. It's maintained and supported by the Department for Digital Services of the University Library.<br/><br/>
Chief: Heiko Weier Phone 3449 Room 2014<br/>
Responsible for TUBdok: Oliver Marahrens Phone 3291 Room 2005<br/>

<br/>
<h4>Hardware</h4>
Server hardware are two redundant dual processor machines.
<br/>
<h4>Software</h4>
The server is running with Linux operating system. Basic is an Apache web server with PHP support.
<p>
TUBdok is based on Opus, which is developed since 1997 at the University Stuttgart. It's programmed in PHP and uses a MySQL database backend. The system maintained by the University Library in Harburg is modified and adopted to our environment.
</p><p>
TUBdok uses Mnogosearch (instead of htdig, which was used in the original Opus software) to search in the fulltexts of the documents. We have our own scripts to make the statistics, using a database with the entries out of Apache logfiles.
</p><p>
You can get OAI conformant data with the interface distributed by the Opus software, adopted and modified by us. The University Library Harburg implemented XMetaDiss for this interface.
</p><p>
All files are marked with an MD5 checksum and signed digitally with a GPG key (at least this is done by the librarian, who enables the document, the author may also sign his documents). This extension for Opus was developed in the University Library Harburg.
