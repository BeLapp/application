<h4>Boolean Operators <b>AND</b>, <b>OR</b>, <b>NOT</b></h4>
<p>When you use the <b>Simple Search</b>, all terms are combined by <b>AND</b> automatically. For a more tightly focused search you may use the 
Boolean Operators to combine different search terms.</p>
<blockquote><b>AND:</b> The document has to contain all search terms.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>OR:</b> The document has to contain one of the search terms. This function broadens your search and is recommended, when there are 
different terms for the same meaning (Synonyms), for example <b>article</b> or <b>paper</b>.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>NOT:</b> This function works excluding: Documents, which contain the one term, may not contain the other. This might be useful to search 
for terms that have different meanings in different contexts. For example <b>arms (biological)</b> or <b>arms (military)</b>.</blockquote>
The Boolean Operators work for the <b>Advanced Search</b> as well. You may use them to combine different search terms within one search field, i.e. to
search documents of an author only within specific years.
<h4>Wildcards</h4>
<p>In the field 'Search:', you may use the symbols '*' and '?' as wildcards. Use them in place of a character or characters that are unknown or that 
may differ. You cannot use them in front of a word or search string.</p>
<blockquote>Example 1: <b>chemi*</b> finds <i>chemical</i> but also <i>chemistry</i> or <i>chemist</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Example 2: <b>licen?e</b> finds <i>licence</i> and <i>license</i>.</blockquote>
<p>You may use single quotation marks (') to search for phrases.</p>
<p>After being inactive for a longer period your results will be erased.</p>
