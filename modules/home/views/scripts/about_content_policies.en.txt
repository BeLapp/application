<li><a name="ziele"><h3>Targets and content criteria for the Document- and Publication Server TUBdok of the TU Hamburg-Harburg</h3></a>
This document server, named TUBdok , allows all members of the Hamburg University of Technics organizational and technical basical conditions to publish scientific dokuments electronically. Scientific documents of high relevance are published regarding the quality standards for research and apprenticeship in the internet. The server is maintained by the University Library. Basically all electronic documents get a persitent identifier (URN) assigned by us and get made accessible via national and international library catalogs, search engines and other detection tools. The document and publication server supports special methods against falsification, like checksums and digital signatures. Additionally long term archiving of the documents is aspired. Handling and development of the document and publication server are involved in national and international initatives and projects like the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) (<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openarchives.org/</a>). The server is based on the software OPUS (<a href="http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/doku/dokumentation.php" target="_blank">http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/doku/dokumentation.php</a>), but this local version contains some individual adaptions, which were developed at the TUB.

<li><a name="sammelauftrag"><h3>The order to collect digital documents for the University Library of the Hamburg University of Technics</h3></a>
The library's order to collect includes to store, ctalog and archive all scientific documents published electronically by members of the Hamburg University of Technics. This alludes not only to pure electronic documents, but also to electronic versions of printed or otherwise published documents. Retro-digitalized documents out of the University Library or associated institutions, which are important for contentual or conservational reasons or to use the documents from anywhere are included as well. The copyright of the original author is not affected. The publication on this document and publication server does not exclude other distribution of your documents in journals or books or on other servers. According to the recommendations of the scientific council all scientists of the University of Technics are supposed to keep the right to publish on such a document repository when placing a contract with a publisher and to publish their documents - after a blocking period if necessary - on this document repository (Recommendations for digital supply with information by university libraries. Edited by the coucil of science, Greifswald 13-July-2001, <a href="http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/texte/4935-01.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/texte/4935-01.pdf</a> (10.12.2001), p. 26; text in german only) The author resp. editor has to take care of respecting and following the copyrights and distribution rights of third persons. The author allows the TUHH and with it the University Library to use the documents for publishing them online in the internet.
</li>

<li><a name="elektrdok"><h3>The digital document</h3></a>
According to this policy an electronic document is defined as a document containing text and graphics, which is stored in a digital form on some digital storage media and which is distributed via computer networks. Multimedia documents containing audio or video sequences are accepted as alectronic documents as well. See below to learn, which file formats are accepted in this context. A document, that should be published on this document and publication server, has to fulfill the following conditions:
<ol>
   <li>It is used to be distributed publicly and open. You can request an exception from that (accessibility restricted by areal or temporal factors) are possible for single documents.</li>
      <li>It is not a dynamic document. If modifications are necessary, the modified electronic document is stored and distributed as a new one.</li>
      
         <li>It is valid and acceptable under the terms and technical requirements of the University Library.</li>
         </ol>
         Electronic documents on TUBdok are differed between original formats and presentation formats. The original format is the file the author created with an editor or a text writing application. The format of the file depends on the system used for creation. The library needs this format to guarantee a long term availability for the document and to create new presentation formats from it if necessary. The presentation format is the format the end user sees. It is created out of the original format to present the document. PDF is the preferred presentation format, but HTML or PS is possible as well.<br/>Multimedia formats can also be divided into original and presentation formats; the same notes as for text formats are valid.
         </li>
         
         <li><a name="publ"><h3>Digital documents, which may be published on the Document and Publication server</h3></a>
         The following types of electronic documents can be provided on this document and publication server:
         <ul>
             <li>Documents, which have to be published according to examination regulations (like dissertations or other kinds of thesis),</li>
                 <li>Documents distributed by members of the University of Technics like collections, congress papers, research papers, e-journals or series and special education materials,</li>
                 
                     <li>Documents by persons or institutions associated with the University of Technics, which are retro-digitalized, because they are important for contentual or conservational reasons or to use the documents from anywhere,</li>
                     </ul>Basically all of the documents provided on this server are available completely public. This rule escacially covers dissertations and habilitations, because they have to be published and distributed without restrictions. You can request an exception from that (accessibility restricted by areal or temporal factors) are possible for single documents - for example on the campus of the University of Technics or certain institutes, but even for external IP addresses or by password.
                     <p>
                     Note about preprints: When a preprint is distributed by a publishing company, the author should notify us about that. We will handle the document following the regulations from the publisher, if possible. Generally we will set a hyperlink to the publishers version of the document and will point out, that the final version can be found there. We will generally not delete the preprint from our document server when the postprint is published unless the author explicitly wants that.</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><a name="sachersch"><h3>Subject indexing on the document server</h3></a>
                     Any document will be subject indexed by the library respectively by the author himself and are available using this classification. The following indexes are supported:
                     <ul>

This guarantees that the document is in its original form and has not been changed. The librarian, who enables the document, signs the document himself digitally with a GPG key. The digital signature is qualified and approved according to the corresponding currently valid law, today this is the German Gesetz &uuml;ber Rahmenbedingungen f&uuml;r elektronische Signaturen (Signaturgesetz SigG).</li>

With this login the author can access statistics for his documents, control the checksums of his own documents and use further internal TUBdok features like personal favourite bookmarks. Without a library card you cannot get access to the document server, even if you uploaded documents! In this case you can request data manually if you need them .</li>

We assign an URN by default for dissertations and habilitations, but it is possible as well for other document types. Only permanent and publicly available documents can get an URN.</li>

The University Library serves by registering the documents in our own catalog and foreign catalogs (catalog of the Common Library Network, catalog of the German National Library, ...). Basically those foreign systems harvest our data via OAI protocol, our server provides the corresponding interface in version 2.0.

The TUB supports Open Access to scientific publications, so we recommend to make the publications available for public and to publish without restrictions. Currently restrictions can be made by IP address or by password. The librarian, who enables the document, cannot be excluded. Documents secured by password will not be included in index tools (search on our document server, our catalog, ...). The author should take care, that the persons permitted to access the ressource, are notified about the URL and the password. Documents restricted by IP address or address space can only be found, if the computer of the user is in the permitted address space. Generally those documents are not taken up into other index tools (like catalogs etc). Restricted docuemnts may be deleted by the university library if the are not used.</li>

The library has to submit metadata and files of electronic dissertations and habilitations to the German National Library to guarantee a long term archivation - if possible. The author of such a paper should submit us the original files in addition to the presentation files (that means the files you used to create the pdf, for example). XML-based formats like XHTML or ODF are preferred, but other plain text formats like SGML, TEX or TXT are acceptable as well.<br/> Please submit your source files of dissertations or habilitations in any case, even if you do not have your work in one of the source formats mentioned. We will try to convert your files into an acceptable format for archivation. The content of your source files will never be changed, we will only change the presentation format, the source files will be left untouched. You can approve that by signing your files digitally or doing an md5 check.<br/> For TEX sources please also submit self defined functions, macros and format packages and non-standard-fonts (if you used some). The sources should be compilable with pdfLaTeX. We will verify your sources for correctness in syntax and compilability (for example using <a href="http://www.texdocc.de/" target="_blank">TeXDocC</a> and/or a test compilation on our systems).<br/>Your presentation format should be PDF if possible. <b>Please note that dissertations and habilitations used to be be submitted to the German National Library on our submission duty shall not be copy restricted in any form (for example by any Digital Rights Management)!</b> You can find further acceptable formats on <a href="/doku/hilfe_formular.php?fid=27&la=en" target="_blank">Help/What demands do you make on my document(s)?</a>.<br/> The period, for that we can guarantee accessability of non-plain-text formats depends on the availability of the format, the reader software and the possibility to convert. So a real long term archivation from todays point of view only seems possible if you submit your source data.</li>

If you want to have a shorter archivation you can choose that in the publication form. When you do that, we will not assign a persistent identifier (URN)to your document and it will not be indexed in our catalog systems.<br/> Dissertations and habilitations cannot be limited. We recommend not to use the limitation option for any document type.</li>
