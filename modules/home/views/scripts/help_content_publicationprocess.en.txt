Please click on the publication link on the start page.<br/>
You have to support different data about your publication 
here (so called metadata), which are used to describe your work in catalogs and other bibliographic 
directories. Many of these fields are mandatory and have to be filled. Which fields are mandatory depends
on the document type. Mandatory fields are for example:<br/>
<ul>
<li>the title of your publication</li>
<li>subject headings, which describe the contents of your document (these subject headings should be taken from a list)</li>
<li>abstract of the contents</li>
<li>the year your document was created in</li>
<li>the type of your document (must be taken from a list)</li>
<li>format of your document (only certain formats are accepted)</li>
<li>Language (must be taken from a list)</li>
<li>your eMail-address</li>
<li>number of files your publication is divided into</li>
</ul>
If you do not know what to provide in certain form fields, you can select the link on the corresponding page 
and an explaining help text should pop up.<br/>
After you have finished the form all data will be displayed once again and you can recheck them and 
correct them if necessary.
